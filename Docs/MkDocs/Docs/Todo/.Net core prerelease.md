# .Net Core prerelease

## Overview

In order to use a version of .Net core still in development
I've detailed the below steps

## Install

First we need to install the installer
looking here https://github.com/dotnet/cli/tree/master
the msi installer for the latest alpha version will be in the list

This will install to C:\Program Files\dotnet\sdk\
This is the sdk used to compile applications

  * latest stable sdk is 1.0.3
  * latest released preview version is .NET Core 2.0.0 Preview 1
    https://github.com/dotnet/core/blob/master/release-notes/download-archives/2.0.0-preview1-download.md

The runtimes will be installed into
C:\Program Files\dotnet\shared\Microsoft.NETCore.App\

Latest stable is 1.1.1

The command prompt will default to the latest version installed

To show version
```
dotnet --version
```

To create a new project
```
dotnet new console -n Test1
```

## Specifying which version to use

After installing a preview version of the sdk
usually running dotnet restore, dotnet build from the command line will work okay
however within visual studio itself it usually defaults to the latest stable version of the sdk such as 1.0.4

this is why running restore from the command line, then build from visual studio some times works
as the restore from the older stable sdk doesn't allow the libs to be found, but the build from the older sdk does work

One approach is supposed to be the use of global.json added to the solution

global.json
```
{
    "sdk": {
        "version": "2.0.0-preview1-005977"
    }
}
```

However I couldn't get this to work under VS2017
so instead I found this

  * https://github.com/aspnet/Announcements/issues/231

settings the user environment variable MSBuildSdksPath
to C:\Program Files\dotnet\sdk\2.0.0-preview1-005977\Sdks

seems to to the trick for building .Net 2.0 within VS 2017
as well as fixing restore, it also allows .Netstandard2.0 libs to be referenced by .netcoreapp2.0 apps within VS2017

The other option is to use the preview version of Visual Studio 2017


Next if we want to specify a specific runtime version in the project file we can use the following

```
<Project Sdk="Microsoft.NET.Sdk">
  <PropertyGroup>
    <OutputType>Exe</OutputType>
    <TargetFramework>netcoreapp2.0</TargetFramework>
    <RuntimeFrameworkVersion>2.0.0-preview2-002093-00</RuntimeFrameworkVersion>
  </PropertyGroup>
</Project>
```

## Running a build

When running a build it's important to do a restore first

```
dotnet restore Test1.csproj
dotnet build Test1.csproj
```


## NuGet packages

Nuget will only contain packages officially released
To gain access to dev packages we need to look to a NuGet package repo outside the norm

This repo contains the libs currently being worked on in dev

## TODO

doesnt work
<PropertyGroup>
    <TargetFramework>netstandard2.0</TargetFramework>
    <NetStandardImplicitPackageVersion>2.0.0-preview2-25226-01</NetStandardImplicitPackageVersion>
</PropertyGroup>

doesnt work
<PackageReference Update="NETStandard.Library" Version="2.0.0-preview2-25226-01" />


TODO
check this out
https://github.com/CoreCompat/System.Drawing/blob/master/src/CoreCompat.System.Drawing/CoreCompat.System.Drawing.csproj

TODO
This seems to work, but it not .Net Standard, just core
try on rpi and windows, wait for official release before moving to .netstandard2.0

<Project Sdk="Microsoft.NET.Sdk">
  <PropertyGroup>
    <TargetFramework>netcoreapp2.0</TargetFramework>
    <RuntimeFrameworkVersion>2.0.0-preview2-002093-00</RuntimeFrameworkVersion>
    <RuntimeIdentifier>win7-x64</RuntimeIdentifier>
  </PropertyGroup>

  <ItemGroup>
    <PackageReference Include="System.Collections.NonGeneric" Version="4.4.0-beta-24913-02" />
    <PackageReference Include="System.Runtime.InteropServices" Version="4.4.0-beta-24913-02" />
  </ItemGroup>
</Project>
