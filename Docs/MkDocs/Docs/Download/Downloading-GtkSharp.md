# Downloading Gtk3-Sharp-Core

## Overview

Currently this is a work in progress so you'll need to build from Source.

  * The build of the C# code is handled via the dotnet cli tool as part of .Net Core (no mono required)
  * The build of the glue libs is now handled via Scons

## Downloading the Source code

First we need to download the source code
```
git clone https://github.com/ASoftTech/Gtk3-Sharp-Core
```
